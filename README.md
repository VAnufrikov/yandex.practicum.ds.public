# Yandex.Practicum Data Science projects
***
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Yandex.Practicum by Data Science

Yandex.Practicum online data analyst program prepares me for a career as a data scientist by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (`Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Scikit-learn`, `Tensorflow`, `Catboost`) and `PostgreSQL` as I build a portfolio of projects.

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recommend you to install `numpy` , `pandas` , `scipy` , `scikit learn` , `matplotlib` , `seaborn` thest basic libraries.
